# Instant Runoff Voting Algorithm

Instead of forcing constituents to select only one out of many candidates, the IRV algorithm allows each voter to rank each candidate from best to worst. You've probably heard the phrase "If you don't vote for candidate_X, you are effectively voting for candidate_Y." IRV elections provide an elegant solution to this argument, allowing voters to more completely express their voices.

I've implemented the IRV algorithm in everybody's favorite readable OOP language, Kotlin! Experiment with modifying the ballotFiles to understand the algorithm.
